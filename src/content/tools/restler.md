name: RESTler
description: RESTler is the first stateful REST API fuzzing tool for automatically testing cloud services through their REST APIs and finding security and reliability bugs in these services. RESTler analyzes the OpenAPI description of a cloud service, and then generates and executes tests that exercise the service through its REST API.  During testing, it checks for specific classes of bugs and dynamically learns how the service behaves from prior service responses.
